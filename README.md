# making-percentile-radars
Files used in my "making percentile radars" project.

In this project, I'm using data from fbref to create "percentile radars" for male football players in Europe's "Big 5" leagues for the current season. Percentile radars show which percentiles a particular row in a data frame falls in across a range of different variables. These kinds of plots are commonplace within media coverage of football and I thought this would make a nice first project for me. I want to create an interactive dashboard, where the user can select a player and see a breakdown of their statistics - I'll be making use of the Shiny package in R to do this.
